## What even is this? 
- This is a project where I want to try to create a Unity-like game creation environment, but for libGDX.
## Goals
1. Practice + experience
2. I want more people to be interested in developing games not only on Unity using C#, but also on other game engines and programming languages.
3. I also want to make the development process easier.
## Plans
1. It is planned to create its own programming language, a little more friendly than Java, so that more people would be interested in it.
2. Creating an interface for creating game scenes and worlds.
3. MAYBE I will create a compiler/interpreter for other existing programming languages or visual programming

Actually, I just want to make my own game! But if you want to use this project as the basis of your own, then please! I will be only glad!
